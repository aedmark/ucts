 GENERATED FILE — do not hand-edit. Produced by tools/gen-social-events.js from
 js/events/social.js (SOCIAL event 6).

 One room per event -- this room IS the event: shows its PrintChoices
 dialog, applies the effects, then hands off via EndTurn() to the next
 room. No custom RoomScript needed (ego is hidden/program-controlled).
