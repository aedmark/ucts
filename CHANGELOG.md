# Changelog

All notable changes to the Unresolved Childhood Trauma Simulator are documented here.

## [2.0.0] - 2026-08-31

### Added
- **20 events across 4 zones** (Work / Home / Social / Self), replacing the original flat pool of 7.
- **Trauma-response tagging** — every choice is tagged `fawn`, `flight`, `fight`, `freeze`, or `secure`.
- **Coping Mechanisms** — leaning on the same response 3 times permanently unlocks a passive modifier on future choices of that type (bad responses compound worse, `secure` compounds better).
- **Card Shuffle glitch choice** — 15% chance per turn of a fourth, unlabeled option with fully randomized stat swings.
- **Adaptive event weighting** — event selection leans toward the zone tied to whichever stat is currently most endangered; no more back-to-back repeats.
- **Extended Therapy (New Game+)** — a 20-turn hard mode, unlocked permanently after a first survival, with all stat swings scaled 1.25x.
- **Five survival endings** (Powder Keg, Performer, Radically Undone, Fragile Equilibrium, Functional Enough) computed from final stat shape, replacing the single generic "You Survived."
- **Field Log** — a second, real-world mode alongside the fictional simulation. Log an actual moment, tag it with the same response vocabulary, and build a persistent local history. Includes a 7-day pattern view, a plain-language dominant-response reading, text export, and a confirm-gated clear. Entries never leave the browser — no backend, no network calls.

### Fixed
- Extended Therapy's unlock flag and the Field Log's storage both now degrade gracefully when `localStorage` is unavailable (e.g. sandboxed/embedded contexts), instead of throwing and silently breaking the win screen or the log.

## [1.0.0] - 2026-08-16
- Initial release: single-file browser game. Three stats (Repression, Social Mask, Inner Child), 7 events, 10-turn survival loop, CRT terminal aesthetic.
