 rm293.sc
 GENERATED FILE — do not hand-edit. Produced by tools/gen-social-events.js from
 the original js/events/social.js (SOCIAL event 27). Re-run
 that script after editing the source event data.

 One room per event (see game.sh and SESSION_HANDOFF.md) -- this room IS
 the event: shows its PrintChoices dialog, applies the chosen response's
 effects, prints its log line, then hands off via EndTurn() (mechanisms.sc)
 to either the next event's room or the ending room. No custom RoomScript
 -- ego is hidden/program-controlled and there's nothing here to click or
 "look" at, and Rm's own `script` property defaults to 0 (a valid,
 handled no-script state) if never set.
